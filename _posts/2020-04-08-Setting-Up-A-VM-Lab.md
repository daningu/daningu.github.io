Where to start with lerning penetration testing and vulnerability assessment?

Easy way is to get your hands dirty and see what is out there. This should give you a great overveiw of what there is to learn and what exactly you want to dive depper in.

There are many ways how to set up a lab to use with vulnerable images/VM's, but this is what I like to use as it does not expose the outside netowrk which the host machine is connected to, but also allowing the vm's to access the internet
This is particularly useful when using tools like metasploit.

Recommended host machine specs (from what experience I have): 

Any processor with more than 2 cores made in the last 10 years

8GB+ RAM

120GB+ SSD for VMs *more would be nice, especially when using snapshots

Internet connection
