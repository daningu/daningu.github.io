"Watching anything in third-person makes you an expert all of a sudden."

It's always easy to watch someone do something, giving you the false impression of "doing it". This blog here is going to change it for me,
as I am planning to write up everything I do Cybersecurity related, with some odd tangents.

So we are going to read, execute, write. Research, do it, write about it.
This is the theme for this blog, to hold me accountable to learn new things and to document them for future reference as well as to learn how
to write (papers, articles, blogs, etc).
